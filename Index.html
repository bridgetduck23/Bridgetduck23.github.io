<h2>“I Would Be Complex”: Misogyny in the Reception of Confessional Poetry</h2>

<h3>1. Confessional Poetry</h3>

<p>Confessional poetry emerged in the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s as a marked shift in poetic practice, focusing intensely on the poet’s own life, emotions and personal experience. The term itself was popularised by a review in 1959 by M. L. Rosenthal of Robert Lowell’s collection <em>Life Studies</em>, in which he stated that Lowell “removes the mask” that previous poets wore when writing about their own lives (Poetry Foundation 2025). What distinguishes confessional poetry is its combination of subject matter, voice, and craft. The speaker is often identified (or strongly recognisable) as the poet, the subject matter includes intimate, sometimes taboo, experiences such as, mental illness, addiction, family breakdown, sexuality, trauma. Confessional poems often employ first-person narration, autobiographical elements, and an un-masked self-confronting shame or experience (Brozak, 2016).</p>

<p>Key figures in the movement include Robert Lowell, whose <em>Life Studies</em> is widely considered the starting point of modern confessional poetry. Lowell’s work combines intensely personal subject matter with formal craft, presenting experiences of family tension, depression, and personal failure with unflinching honesty (Poetry Foundation 2025). Sylvia Plath, another central confessional poet, explores themes of mental illness, identity, and emotional turmoil in collections such as <em>Ariel</em>, using vivid imagery and metaphor to translate private suffering into powerful lyrical art. Anne Sexton, likewise, engages with subjects that were once considered taboo, such as death, sexuality, and personal trauma, turning intimate experiences into public reflection (Brozak, 2016). Other notable poets, including W. D. Snodgrass and John Berryman, also contributed to the confessional mode by centering personal life in poetry, often blending autobiographical specificity with universal human concerns (Poets.org 2025).</p>

<p>Several thematic elements recur across confessional poetry. These include the exploration of mental and emotional struggle, complex familial relationships, and existential questions about life and mortality. By turning inward, confessional poets place private experience at the heart of their work, creating a sense of immediacy and intimacy. Despite the deeply personal subject matter, confessional poetry is not unstructured, it maintains attention to poetic craft through rhythm, imagery, metaphor, and careful diction. This balance of raw self-revelation with formal skill is what allows confessional poetry to resonate beyond the individual poet’s life, transforming personal experience into shared human insight.</p>

<p>Moreover, confessional poetry also represents a deliberate break from previous, more impersonal traditions, such as the New Criticism, which emphasised formalism and objectivity. By foregrounding the poet’s own “I,” confessional poetry opened up new possibilities for lyric expression, emphasising that private emotion could be the central subject of serious artistic work. This movement not only influenced subsequent generations of poets but also continues to shape other forms of art, including contemporary songwriters who adopt a confessional style in their lyrics (Poets.org 2025).</p>

<p>Confessional poetry is defined by its candid exploration of the self, its focus on intimate or taboo experiences, and its careful attention to poetic craft. The confessional poet acts as both witness and interpreter of personal experience, transforming private emotion into public art. Through the confessional mode, poets like Lowell, Plath, and Sexton demonstrate that the intensely personal can also be universally resonant, making confessional poetry a defining movement in modern literature.</p>

<h3>2. Taylor Swift as a Confessional Poet</h3>

<h4>I. Introduction</h4>

<p>In order to use Taylor Swift as an effective example to ultimately examine the misogynistic reception of confessional poetry, it is essential to first situate Swift as a confessional poet rather than merely an American popstar. Analysing Swift’s 11th studio album <em>The Tortured Poets Department</em> allows for the confirmation of confession as a central mode of her artistic expression. Combing through the braids of TTPD’s complete era, including the double album edition <em>The Anthology</em>, and the record’s summary poem “In Summation”, reveals Swift’s deliberate construction of a self-reflexive confessional narrative that blurs the boundaries between personal experience and artistic performance.</p>

<p><em>The Tortured Poets Department</em> is described by Swift as “an anthology of new works that reflect events, opinions, and sentiments from a fleeting and fatalistic moment in time”. Consisting of 31 songs and a concluding poem, the album presents a body of work that not only invites but demands poetic analysis, foregrounding Swift’s lyrical craftsmanship and thematic continuity across the confessional mode. Closely investigating the song “Guilty as Sin?” in regard to TTPD as a whole, while also considering Swift’s wider body of work, reveals the deliberate use of literary techniques to highlight confession as both a poetic device and a means of self-mythologising.</p>

<h4>II. Context</h4>

<p>Taylor Swift notoriously maintains a carefully curated sense of privacy, choosing when and how she is seen or heard. This controlled self-presentation extends to her romantic life, as her personal and private experiences become public within her confessional style. Within her lyricism, Swift selectively allows her illicit affairs to be analysed in order to interpret what remains hidden behind the public façade. TTPD stands as her most overtly confessional album, one that relies on an understanding of her artistic and personal history to grasp its layered, poetic narratives.</p>

<p>Swift began working on TTPD after finishing her tenth studio album, <em>Midnights</em> (2022), and continued to develop the project during the Eras Tour throughout the entirety of 2023. During the album’s conception, Swift had ended her six-year relationship with English actor Joe Alwyn. Though this relationship was long-term and private, TTPD shifts its emotional focus toward a brief but intense connection with English singer Matty Healy. While the public relationship lasted only two months, the album’s narrative suggests a far longer emotional entanglement, reinforcing that emotional weight rather than duration is what drives the confessional mode. This aligns Swift clearly with the confessional poetic tradition, in which life events are framed, selected, and shaped rather than simply reported.</p>

<h4>III. Lyrical Analysis</h4>

<p>Track nine from TTPD, “Guilty as Sin?”, encapsulates Swift’s confessional mode as she articulates emotional and moral tension while framing desire as both intimate and transgressive. The song opens with the line “Drowning in The Blue Nile / He sent me ‘Downtown Lights’,” which layers intertextual and symbolic meanings. The Blue Nile’s music carries themes of longing and romantic distance, while Swift’s use of blue throughout her discography associates the colour with her relationship with Joe Alwyn. By contrast, Swift employs red imagery to evoke her tumultuous connection with Matty Healy, with songs like “Maroon” framing desire as intoxicating, staining, and consuming.</p>

<p>The song incorporates religious language to frame desire as something tied to guilt, revelation, and moral conflict. Lines such as “I’m seeing visions, am I bad? / Or mad? Or wise?” position longing as a crisis of interpretation, while the bridge’s reference to rolling away the stone and crucifixion invokes themes of judgement and self-sacrifice. When Swift concludes with “I choose you and me… religiously,” she resolves the tension by naming desire as devotion rather than sin, transforming guilt into agency.</p>

<h4>IV. Conclusion</h4>

<p>Overall, “Guilty as Sin?” demonstrates how Swift’s confessional mode functions across <em>The Tortured Poets Department</em>, revealing the ways she turns interior emotion into a carefully constructed narrative of desire, guilt, and self-reflection. Through colour symbolism, intertextual reference, and religious imagery, Swift reshapes private experience into a multi-layered storytelling mode.</p>

<h3>3. The Misogyny Behind the Reception of Confessional Poetry</h3>

<p>The reception of confessional poetry has long been shaped by gendered assumptions about whose emotional lives are considered artistically legitimate. This dynamic extends into contemporary music culture, where Taylor Swift stands as a visible example of how autobiographical expression by women continues to be trivialised. Like Sylvia Plath and Anne Sexton, Swift’s work is frequently reduced to emotional display rather than recognised for its lyrical construction and thematic complexity.</p>

<p>While male artists who write autobiographically are praised for authenticity or emotional intelligence, Swift is accused of oversharing or weaponising personal experience. This reveals a continued discomfort with women speaking authoritatively about their inner lives. Swift’s refusal to censor emotional complexity becomes framed not as artistic depth but as excess, echoing the historical dismissal of women within the confessional tradition.</p>

<p>Yet Swift, like the confessional poets before her, uses vulnerability strategically. Her confessional mode is not a raw outpouring but a controlled lyrical craft that reshapes personal history into narrative power. The backlash therefore exposes cultural discomfort rather than artistic limitation.</p>
