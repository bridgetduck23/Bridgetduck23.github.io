      <h2>1. Confessional Poetry</h2>
      <p>Confessional poetry emerged in the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s as a marked shift in poetic practice, focusing intensely on the poet’s own life, emotions and personal experience. The term itself was popularised by a review in 1959 by M. L. Rosenthal of Robert Lowell’s collection <em>Life Studies</em>, in which he stated that Lowell “removes the mask” that previous poets wore when writing about their own lives (Poetry Foundation 2025). What distinguishes confessional poetry is its combination of subject matter, voice, and craft. The speaker is often identified (or strongly recognisable) as the poet, the subject matter includes intimate, sometimes taboo, experiences such as, mental illness, addiction, family breakdown, sexuality, trauma. Confessional poems often employ first-person narration, autobiographical elements, and an un-masked self-confronting shame or experience (Brozak, 2016).</p>

      <p>Key figures in the movement include Robert Lowell, whose <em>Life Studies</em> is widely considered the starting point of modern confessional poetry. Lowell’s work combines intensely personal subject matter with formal craft, presenting experiences of family tension, depression, and personal failure with unflinching honesty (Poetry Foundation 2025). Sylvia Plath, another central confessional poet, explores themes of mental illness, identity, and emotional turmoil in collections such as <em>Ariel</em>, using vivid imagery and metaphor to translate private suffering into powerful lyrical art. Anne Sexton, likewise, engages with subjects that were once considered taboo, such as death, sexuality, and personal trauma, turning intimate experiences into public reflection (Brozak, 2016). Other notable poets, including W. D. Snodgrass and John Berryman, also contributed to the confessional mode by centering personal life in poetry, often blending autobiographical specificity with universal human concerns (Poets.org 2025).</p>

      <p>Several thematic elements recur across confessional poetry. These include the exploration of mental and emotional struggle, complex familial relationships, and existential questions about life and mortality. By turning inward, confessional poets place private experience at the heart of their work, creating a sense of immediacy and intimacy. Despite the deeply personal subject matter, confessional poetry is not unstructured, it maintains attention to poetic craft through rhythm, imagery, metaphor, and careful diction. This balance of raw self-revelation with formal skill is what allows confessional poetry to resonate beyond the individual poet’s life, transforming personal experience into shared human insight.</p>

      <p>Moreover, confessional poetry also represents a deliberate break from previous, more impersonal traditions, such as the New Criticism, which emphasised formalism and objectivity. By foregrounding the poet’s own “I,” confessional poetry opened up new possibilities for lyric expression, emphasising that private emotion could be the central subject of serious artistic work. This movement not only influenced subsequent generations of poets but also continues to shape other forms of art, including contemporary songwriters who adopt a confessional style in their lyrics (Poets.org 2025).</p>

      <p>Confessional poetry is defined by its candid exploration of the self, its focus on intimate or taboo experiences, and its careful attention to poetic craft. The confessional poet acts as both witness and interpreter of personal experience, transforming private emotion into public art. Through the confessional mode, poets like Lowell, Plath, and Sexton demonstrate that the intensely personal can also be universally resonant, making confessional poetry a defining movement in modern literature.</p>

      <h2>2. Taylor Swift as a Confessional Poet</h2>

      <h3>I. Introduction</h3>
      <p>In order to use Taylor Swift as an effective example to ultimately examine the misogynistic reception of confessional poetry, it is essential to first situate Swift as a confessional poet rather than merely an American popstar. Analysing Swift’s 11th studio album <em>THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT</em> (TTPD) allows for the confirmation of confession as a central mode of her artistic expression. Combing through the braids of TTPD’s complete era, including the double album edition <em>THE ANTHOLOGY</em>, and the record’s summary poem “In Summation”, reveals Swift’s deliberate construction of a self-reflexive confessional narrative that blurs the boundaries between personal experience and artistic performance. <em>THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT</em> is described by Swift as “an anthology of new works that reflect events, opinions, and sentiments from a fleeting and fatalistic moment in time”. Consisting of 31 songs and a concluding poem, the album presents a body of work that not only invites but demands poetic analysis, foregrounding Swift’s lyrical craftsmanship and thematic continuity across the confessional mode. Closely investigating the song “Guilty as Sin?” in regard to TTPD as a whole, while also considering Swift’s wider body of work, reveals the deliberate use of literary techniques to highlight confession as both a poetic device and a means of self-mythologising.</p>

      <h3>II. Context</h3>
      <p>Taylor Swift notoriously maintains a carefully curated sense of privacy, choosing when and how she is seen or heard. This controlled self-presentation extends to her romantic life, as her personal and private experiences become public within her confessional style. Within her lyricism, Swift selectively allows her illicit affairs to be analysed in order to interpret what remains hidden behind the public façade. TTPD stands as her most overtly confessional album, one that relies on an understanding of her artistic and personal history to grasp its layered, poetic narratives. Through its expansive 31-track structure, the album encourages critical examination of the public relationships it references and reimagines.</p>

      <p>Swift began working on TTPD after finishing her tenth studio album, <em>Midnights</em> (2022), and continued to develop the project during the Eras Tour throughout the entirety of 2023. During the album’s conception, Swift had ended her six-year relationship with English actor Joe Alwyn. Swift’s longest relationship was kept deliberately private, fuelled by speculation that Alwyn preferred to avoid the spotlight and may have felt overshadowed by her global stature. Swift’s lengthy relationship with Alwyn might have seemed the natural focus for a confessional album, but TTPD instead foregrounds a brief but emotionally intense connection with English singer Matty Healy. Shortly after her split from Alwyn in April 2023, Swift entered a brief relationship with Healy, which concluded by June of the same year. Though publicly known as a two-month relationship, the album’s lyrical disclosures suggest a decade-long on-and-off love affair that pre-dates and underpins this fleeting reunion. This revelation reframes the album’s emotional centre, demonstrating how emotional intensity rather than chronological length drives poetic exploration. The public invisibility and secrecy surrounding this connection further amplify the album’s confessional power, allowing Swift to manipulate personal narrative into art. By prioritising a short-lived yet significant relationship over a long-term partnership, Swift aligns with the confessional tradition, where selective disclosure and narrative framing shape both meaning and audience reception.</p>

      <h3>III. Lyrical Analysis</h3>
      <p>Track nine from TTPD, “Guilty as Sin?”, perfectly encapsulates Swift’s confessional mode as she articulates intense emotional and moral tension while framing desire as both intimate and transgressive. The biblically allusive song explores the relationship between sin and sainthood as Swift questions the holy definition of “guilt” whilst daydreaming about her lover.</p>

      <p>Swift opens “Guilty as Sin?” with the line, “Drowning in The Blue Nile / He sent me ‘Downtown Lights’.” What initially appears as a casual lyric reference is, in fact, densely layered with double meanings and recurring motifs of blue and red. “The Downtown Lights,” a song by The Blue Nile, carries emotional and symbolic resonance beyond its surface allusion; it is a track about love, longing, and desire, thematically central to Swift’s own confessional palette. Its release in 1989, the year of Swift’s birth, further entwines the intertext with personal mythology, transforming the reference into a generational and self-reflexive gesture.</p>

      <p>Overtly a pun on the band’s name, Swift’s claim that she is “drowning in The Blue Nile” simultaneously reveals the overwhelming nature of Alwyn’s depression and the melancholic weight that permeated their relationship. This association is established by Swift’s recurring use of the colour blue as a symbolic marker of this relationship across her discography. From albums <em>Reputation</em> (2017) to <em>The Life of a Showgirl</em> (2025), she consistently employs the motif within lyrics such as “I’m with you even if it makes me blue”, “If your cascade ocean wave blues come”, and “Don’t want no other shade of blue but you”. Evoking emotional exhaustion, sadness, and romantic disillusionment, Swift allows listeners to trace the evolution of this dynamic through colour imagery, hence Alwyn becomes inextricably associated with the melancholy and stillness that the colour blue signifies across her body of work.</p>

      <p>Moreover, the reference to “The Downtown Lights” simultaneously gestures toward Matty Healy, who functions as a symbolic “light”, erratic, alluring, and ultimately fleeting. Similar to how the colour blue functions as a relational motif throughout her work, Swift employs the colour red to symbolise the passionate and volatile nature of her connection with Healy. This association is most vividly expressed in “Maroon” from the album <em>Midnights</em>, through lyrics such as “The burgundy on my T-shirt when you splashed your wine into me” and “The lips I used to call home, so scarlet it was maroon.” Here, red is not merely a symbol of love but of excess, a deepening of passion into something stained, intoxicating, and consuming. The song by The Blue Nile describes the glow of streetlights against urban isolation, a tension between illumination and loneliness that mirrors Swift’s portrayal of this relationship. By invoking the imagery of light within a lyric that begins with drowning, Swift establishes an immediate emotional polarity: Alwyn’s depressive “blue” becomes contrasted with Healy’s chaotic, incandescent “red.”</p>

      <p>Continually, the following lines “I hadn’t heard it in a while / My boredom’s bone deep” further reinforce the motifs through the deliberate use of alliteration. The repeated soft “h” in “I hadn’t heard it in a while” evokes breathy introspection and emotional delicacy as if whispered or expressed in a defeated state, contrasted with the plosive “b” sounds of “my boredom’s bone deep,” which convey weight and inescapable rigidity. This sonic opposition mirrors the thematic tension between temptation and restraint, enhancing the confessional tone of the lyrics.</p>

      <p>Promptly establishing these opposing relationships allows for the exploration of sin and sainthood, depicting the religiously nuanced idea of desire within contemporary fantasies. Swift uses religiously charged language within “I’m seeing visions, am I bad? / Or mad? Or wise?”, invoking the verbiage of prophecy to frame her desire as an experience that questions moral certainty. The triadic questioning recalls the way biblical figures were viewed as sinful, delusional, or divinely inspired, positioning her longing within a continuum of spiritual ambiguity. Swift presents desire as something that can reveal truth but also cross moral boundaries, highlighting the album’s interest in how devotion, temptation, and self-understanding overlap.</p>

      <p>Swift continues this common theme within lines such as “Without ever touching his skin / How can I be guilty as sin?” and “If it’s make believe / Why does it feel like a vow / We’ll both uphold somehow?”, blurring the line between fantasy and commitment, suggesting that imagined desire can generate its own form of responsibility and transgression. Swift deepens the tension between internal longing and external moral judgement, reinforcing the song’s ongoing negotiation between innocence, guilt, and the narratives she constructs around love.</p>

      <p>Moreover, the religiously laden bridge operates as a confessional breakthrough, where Swift momentarily collapses her earlier uncertainty and confronts the full weight of her guilt-driven desire. Swift preaches “What if I roll the stone away? / They’re gonna crucify me anyway / What if the way you hold me / Is actually what’s holy?” concluding the stanza with “I choose you and me / … Religiously”. This moment strengthens the song’s spiritual tone, turning her desire into something that feels risky but also meaningful. The references to rolling the stone away and being “crucified” frame her feelings within ideas of judgement and consequence, while also hinting at renewal. When she ends with “I choose you and me… religiously,” Swift resolves the earlier tension by treating her choice as a kind of personal belief or commitment. It becomes the point where she accepts her desire instead of questioning it. Ultimately, “Guilty as Sin?” highlights Swift’s ability to turn private thoughts into a structured narrative of moral conflict. Swift successfully uses colour symbolism and religious imagery to elevate desire from a fleeting emotion to a site of ethical and spiritual negotiation. The song confirms how Swift’s confessional mode operates: she shapes and explores her complex emotions through metaphor, symbolism, and allusion.</p>

      <h3>IV. Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Overall, “Guilty as Sin?” demonstrates how Swift’s confessional mode functions across <em>The Tortured Poets Department</em>, revealing the ways she turns interior emotion into a carefully constructed narrative of desire, guilt, and doubt. By weaving together colour symbolism, intertextual references, and religiously charged language, Swift shows how fantasy and morality can coexist within the same emotional landscape. The track ultimately illustrates her broader lyrical approach throughout the album: she does not simply express feeling, but actively shapes it through layered metaphors and recurring motifs. In this way, “Guilty as Sin?” becomes a key example of how Swift reframes private experience into a complex, reflective, and deeply intentional mode of storytelling.</p>

      <h2>3. The Misogyny Behind the Reception of Confessional Poetry</h2>
      <p>The reception of confessional poetry has long been shaped by gendered assumptions about whose emotional lives are considered artistically legitimate. This dynamic extends beyond literature into contemporary music culture, where Taylor Swift stands as one of the most visible examples of how autobiographical expression by women continues to be trivialised, pathologised, or weaponised against them. Although Swift’s songwriting aligns closely with the confessional tradition through its introspection, emotional precision, and narrative self-exposure, her work is often dismissed as oversharing, melodramatic, or exploitative, echoing the critical patterns that shaped the reception of Sylvia Plath, Anne Sexton, and other women poets whose art was reduced to personal instability rather than craft.</p>

      <p>Swift’s lyrics frequently become the focus of reductive scrutiny that treats her work as gossip rather than literature. Instead of engaging with her metaphors, motifs, or structural choices, popular and critical discourse often fixates on identifying the men in her songs. This parallels the way Plath and Sexton were read through biography rather than technique, their artistry eclipsed by voyeuristic fascination with their private lives. Swift’s refusal to name the subjects of her songs becomes irrelevant, as audiences and media insist on framing her entire body of work as an emotional report rather than a crafted narrative shaped by persona, symbol, and rhetorical choice. This response reflects a broader misogynistic expectation that women’s speech is inherently emotional, excessive, and therefore less serious or controlled.</p>

      <p>The double standard becomes more pronounced when Swift is compared to male artists who also draw heavily from their personal experiences. Male songwriters who write about past relationships, such as Bob Dylan or The Weeknd, are often praised for emotional depth or poetic complexity. Swift, in contrast, is accused of “writing too many breakup songs,” a critique grounded not in her work but in discomfort with a woman confidently framing her own perspective. The criticism is not aimed at confessional form itself but at Swift’s gendered position within it. This mirrors the reception of confessional poets in the mid-twentieth century, where Robert Lowell’s autobiographical work was celebrated as brave and innovative, while similar material from women was labelled indulgent or pathological.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, Swift’s confessional mode disrupts cultural expectations surrounding femininity, privacy, and sexual agency. When she writes about desire, grief, fantasy, or guilt, she challenges the notion that women should be silent about their emotional and erotic lives. The backlash against her confessional writing therefore acts as a disciplinary mechanism, echoing historical patterns where women’s self-revelation is treated as a threat to social order. In songs such as “Guilty as Sin?”, Swift uses religious imagery, emotional ambiguity, and symbolic colour palettes not simply to recount personal events, but to interrogate the moral frameworks imposed upon women’s desire. Yet even these sophisticated artistic choices are often overshadowed by a gendered fixation on who the song is “about.”</p>

      <p>Despite this persistent misogynistic reception, Swift, like the women confessional poets before her, transforms vulnerability into a controlled artistic strategy. Her work demonstrates that confessional writing is not a spill of unmediated feeling but a conscious mode that reconfigures the relationship between private experience and public voice. The criticism she receives therefore reveals less about the quality of her work and more about cultural discomfort with women who narrate their own emotional lives with authority. Reading Swift within the lineage of confessional poetry allows her songwriting to be understood not as celebrity disclosure, but as a continuation of a literary tradition where women use confession as a tool of power, resistance, and aesthetic innovation.</p>
